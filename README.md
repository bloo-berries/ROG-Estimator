# Benign Gynecologic Mass Growth Rate Calculator

An evidence-based web application for estimating growth patterns of benign gynecologic masses with enhanced accuracy using validated clinical models and latest research data.

## Features

- **Four Mass Types**: Endometrioma, Uterine Fibroids, Simple Ovarian Cysts, and Complex Ovarian Cysts
- **Li et al. Predictive Model**: 82.5% accuracy with laboratory value integration (FSH, LH, lipid profile)
- **Multi-Time Point Projections**: 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36-month growth forecasts
- **Volume-Based Calculations**: More accurate than diameter-based measurements
- **Enhanced Risk Stratification**: IOTA Simple Rules and O-RADS categories for complex cysts
- **Malignancy Risk Assessment**: Evidence-based risk calculation for postmenopausal women
- **Evidence-Based Algorithms**: Based on comprehensive research data with precise growth rate ranges
- **Dynamic Input Forms**: Tailored questions based on selected mass type
- **Growth Projections**: Visual representation of size changes over time
- **Clinical Recommendations**: Evidence-based management suggestions with confidence intervals
- **Advanced Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk factor analysis and stratification

## Enhanced Research Integration

### Latest Research Sources
- **PMC7536392**: Enhanced endometrioma recurrence patterns and treatment outcomes
- **Ovarian Research BMC**: Updated ovarian cyst behavior and growth patterns
- **Herald Open Access**: Advanced persistence and recurrence data for ovarian endometrioma

### Key Algorithm Improvements
- **Enhanced Growth Rate Precision**: More accurate ranges based on latest studies
- **Improved Recurrence Prediction**: Better risk stratification for post-surgical patients
- **Advanced Treatment Effectiveness**: Updated medication impact calculations
- **Malignancy Risk Assessment**: Evidence-based risk calculation for postmenopausal women
- **O-RADS Integration**: Standardized risk categorization for complex cysts
